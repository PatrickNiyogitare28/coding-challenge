BAG Innovation Coding Challenge

## Getting Started

- Clone the app
- Run `yarn install`
- Use the bellow guid to configure the db environment to be able to successfully connect to the db
### Setting up the database
This challenge is implemented using Postgresql db, the mapping is handled by [prisma](https://www.prisma.io/);

Prerequisites to successfully connect to Pg DB

- [X] Install postgresql db
- [X] Create a database and name it `bag-coding-challenge-dev-db` as it was used in the challenge implementation
### The next thing is to create you're db connection url
- Go in `.env` file
- Modify the `DATABASE_URL` variable to mutch your local db configurations

> This is how we go about it

`postgres` stands for your postgresql user, currently I'm using the default one.

`password` stands for your postgresql user password

`localhost:5432` stands for the connection url where your db is running

> The above variables you need to change them depending on the environment in which you're running your postgresq in.

### Next step is to run the postgresql prisma migrations

Running the migration will automatically create the entities used in the challenge.. which is the last step

Use the bellow command to be able to run migrations

`npx prisma db push`

If you're what to preveiw the db schemas and entities, [prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) provides an npx script that open the prisma studio on 5555

This is the command to go.

`npx prisma studio`

The preview is rendered on `localhost:5555`
